  Reviews any workflow artifact — the commands, skills, and project docs that are the
  tooling (READMEs, stories, CLAUDE.md, and the like) — against five goal questions:
  one clear job, complete, a goal not a frozen spec, fits the studio, right for its
  reader. Not for the published deliverables the product generates (test plans, cases,
  emails, demos) — those go to the typography + phrasing review. Floor, not ceiling.

# reviewing-artifacts

One reviewer for every workflow artifact. It does not score against a fixed checklist
or a published standard — it asks a few questions about whether the artifact does its
job and fits this project, and trusts your judgment for the rest.

**The questions are a floor, not a ceiling.** If something hurts the artifact and
isn't listed below, flag it anyway.

**Scope.** Review whatever artifact you're handed, *by kind* — commands, skills,
READMEs, stories, CLAUDE.md, and anything like them. Don't tie this skill to a fixed
inventory of the current commands and skills; new ones appear and old ones change. The
**published deliverables the product generates** for outside readers — test plans, test
cases, review emails, demo files, and the like — are reviewed by the typography +
phrasing deliverable review, **not here**.

## The five questions

Ask these of any artifact. The artifact's type shifts which ones bite hardest.

1. **One clear job.** Can you say what this file is for in a sentence? Does everything
   in it serve that one job? Flag sprawl (steps that wander off) and heavy overlap with
   another artifact (could it merge, or go away?).
2. **Complete.** Does it deliver that job end to end — no missing steps, placeholder
   text, or dead instructions that produce nothing? A reader/agent should be able to act.
3. **Goal, not frozen spec — and no hardcoding.** Does it state intent and leave room
   where room belongs, instead of freezing a "how" that will drift? Flag stale paths or
   filenames, magic values that should be derived, rigid step-by-step where a principle
   would do, and references to tools or layouts that have moved.
4. **Fits the studio.** GitHub-native, markdown as the source of truth, goals over
   specs. No leftover coupling to retired tools (Jira / Confluence / Jenkins) unless
   it's a deliberate adapter. Cross-references resolve to files that exist.
5. **Right for its reader.** Agent-facing (commands, skills): unambiguous instructions
   the agent can follow. Human-facing (README, story): reads like a person wrote it for
   a person — clear, concrete, scannable.

Where each type leans:

| Artifact | Leans on |
|----------|----------|
| Command / skill | Q3 (no hardcoding), Q5 (agent can follow it) |
| README / user doc | Q5 (reads for a human), Q1 (one clear job) |
| Story | Q3 (goal, not spec) — this is what `dw-review-story` checks at the story stage |
| CLAUDE.md | Q2/Q4 (matches the repo as it actually is — no orphaned references) |

## Steps

1. **Scope.** A single file, a folder, or "the files I just changed." Find where the
   artifacts actually live in *this* repo — don't assume a fixed layout.
2. **Read** the target(s).
3. **Ask the five questions** of each. Checklists are a floor — note anything else that
   weakens the artifact.
4. **Report** (below).
5. **Fix (if asked).** Smallest blast radius first: remove leaked hardcoding, fill gaps,
   tighten wording. Structural changes — merging, splitting, or removing an artifact —
   need explicit confirmation. Never delete an artifact without approval; flag it for
   removal instead.

## Report

Per artifact, a short verdict and the specific findings — no numeric score.

```
<artifact path> — PASS | REVISE | CUT

- [Q#] <finding, with line reference> → <smallest fix>
```

- **PASS** — does its job, fits the studio, nothing leaked.
- **REVISE** — specific, fixable findings (gaps, hardcoding, drift, readability).
- **CUT** — duplicates another artifact or does nothing useful; propose removal (with approval).

End with the path(s) reviewed and the suggested next step.
